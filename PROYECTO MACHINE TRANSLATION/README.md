We started conducting research on machine translation models with neural networks, in order to know which models we could use. 
Three repositories were highlighted as the basis for the project (attached in the bibliography).
Having better knowledge of the models to use, several tests were made with them considering various variations in order to find the best model, considering an initial dataset of 10000 data. Once the final model was found, a dataset of 80000 data was prepared to train a model that can translate from Spanish to English and another model from English to Spanish. In both, each epoch took about 26 to 50 minutes. (time varied by machine)
